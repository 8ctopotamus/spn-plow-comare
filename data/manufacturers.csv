http://articles.snowplownews.com/page/arctic,0,0,22763 S Center Rd,,1,Frankfort,33,"<br /> <p>The Sectional Sno-Pusher is compatible with several types of equipment including wheel loaders backhoes, skid steers, compact loaders and tractors. The Sectional is ideal for construction and landscape contractors looking for a productive solution for inactive equipment during the winter months, as well as established snow and ice control professionals.</p> <p>The Arctic Sectional is simply the most efficient, effective all encompassing pusher on the market today. From sidewalks to parking lots. If you want to take your snow contracting business to a level the competition can't match.</p> <p>Sectional Sno-Pusher, a division of Arctic Snow and Ice Products Bradley IL, offers three lines of unique snow pushers, the HD, LD and CD models. They are compatible with wheel loaders, back-hoes, skid steers, compact loaders, and tractors.</p> <p>Incorporating several unique features, the Sectional pushers increase snow removal efficiency and reduce fuel costs. The patented steel moldboard design is made of 32, 30 and 24-inch-wide individual sections depending on the model, each featuring spring-loaded trip edges. The exclusive moldboard design combines the precision of a small plow with the capacity of a large pusher.</p> <p>The separate sections move independently of one another, allowing the unit to contour to the surface and scrape snow and ice out of dips and recessions, all while moving over raised objects. This enhances plowing efficiency and protects operators from impact injuries and minimizes property damage.</p> <p>Each moldboard section features an AR-400 hardened-steel trip cutting edge, designed to scrape snow and ice down to the pavement. In addition to removing compacted ice and snow, the cutting edge's sectional design is also more economical. On a typical one-piece moldboard plow or pusher, the entire cutting edge must be replaced when damaged. In the event that a Sectional Sno-Pusher's cutting edge is damaged, only the individual section needs to be replaced.</p> <p>The pusher operates independently of the machine and automatically adjusts to the pavement grade, resulting in fewer missed areas and less follow-up plowing. Additionally, the patented Slip Hitch ensures all four tires remain on the pavement at all times. As a result, the machine is able to achieve full traction, and eliminate drag and loss of horsepower. </p> <p>Our customers have reported salt savings as high as 50% and fuel savings exceeding 30% easily out performing any other pusher on the market today and designed for equipment weighing 5,000 to 60,000 the Sectional pushers are available to accommodate all your snow removal needs.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/arcticsnowandice/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel,2,1,00:00.0,,Arctic-Logo-Products-2006.jpg,Arctic Equipment Mfg Co,,"<p>Three decades ago, in 1978, Arctic Snow and Ice Control Founder Randy Strait began plowing professionally with a Western snowplow fitted onto a 1977 Chevy Blazer. One year later, during a record breaking snow season in Chicagoland, Strait would establish himself as a dependable snow removal service, and set him on the path to creating Arctic Snow and Ice Control.</p> <p>Thirty years later, Arctic is a multi-million dollar company with over 300 team members dedicated to the business of snow and ice control. The company handles clients in the retail and commercial industries and provides each one with the same dedication Randy Strait demonstrated thirty years ago. Each operator at the company follows a strict guideline to ensure every customer receives professional and efficient plowing. Taking the time to do the job the right way is one of the company's fundamental philosophies. At Arctic Snow and Ice Control, snow is not an afterthought, it is our only thought.</p>",(815) 469-8001,,Arctic,arctic,IL,https://twitter.com/ArcticSnoIceInc,www.arcticsnowandice.com,http://www.youtube.com/user/ArcticSnowandIceInc,PLM1lIdVLPCXWCJadvM7NBNecMZELE3g9i,,60423

The timing could not have been better. The U.S. population was gravitating toward suburban settings, which had increased the market for light trucks and drove demand for snowplows.</li> <li>Suburban areas continued to thrive through the 50s, and the light-truck market continued to grow. Snowplow demand was on the rise, and sales of Western snowplows doubled between 1961 and 1968.</li> <li>The 70s also proved lucrative for the snowplow industry. With a product that was perceived as high quality, an aggressive sales force and an attractive pricing policy, Western Products' share of the national market for snowplows mounted on light trucks swelled from 33 percent in 1968 to 40 percent a decade later.</li> </ul> <h3>Product Lines:</h3> <p><b>Snow Removal Equipment</b> - forged by hard-working men and women in our award-winning Milwaukee, Wisconsin, manufacturing facility.

And by the late 1970’s, annual production was as high as 100,000 machines. By 2005, Ariens had produced 2 million Sno-Tho machines.

,0,0,5138 Bernville Rd,,0,Bernville,,"<p>Wow its been 30 years and a lot has changed. Storks is a Christian, family-run business that was founded in 1986 by Gene and Theresa Stork. We are now a full time year round strictly snow business, but the business started as a small automotive repair shop that specialized in Jeeps. Prior to owning the business, Gene worked at a Jeep dealership and had a plowing business, plowing 30 parking lots and driveways. The first winter of owning the shop he realized that being committed to both plowing and running the shop was not going to work, so he gave up the snow contracts. Still having our plows and dealing in Jeeps we sold a few used plows each year, but because we still loved to plow snow we kept around half a dozen jeeps with plows on. However, we noticed that we enjoyed installing and servicing snow plows and began rebuilding used snow plows because of the demand for lower-priced and used plows.</p> <p>Rebuilding plows also fueled the sales of new plows. In 1996 we became a Meyer/Diamond sub dealer. After some good years of sales, Meyer let us in as a Direct dealer. And we also took on Fisher as a sub distributor. Within a few years (in 2001) we became an official distributor for Blizzard. Shortly after we also took on Sno-Way. We were given the opportunity to take on Boss, as a local distributor had closed its doors, but the day we were to sign the contract it didn’t happen. We would later find it was a blessing in disguise because we were offered the opportunity to go Direct with Western in 2006. Blizzard was re branded as SnowEx in 2015, so we also took on the SnowEx plows.</p> <p>We love to offer parts that are hard to get / discontinued - we buy up old inventory and direct source anything we can. When brands go out like Blizzard, and Curtis, we stock up on their parts more than ever, and we have more Blizzard part in stock than any dealer in the country. Storks Plows has over 1000 plows in stock all year round, both new and used, and all brands to give you many to choose from. We also have a large inventory of plow pumps, mounts, blades, wiring kits and plow pump parts. We do not sell the most plows but we are believed to have the largest divers inventory in the World. We have had the privilege of having Meyer, Western, Fisher, Blizzard, and Snowex employees tour the Storks compound and see what a full stock is. Over the last 30 years we have grown to add the 3 properties around the shop to multiply our size and build a large warehouse in addition to the buildings we acquired with the property. This has allowed us to stock more and better organize what we have. We have also given up the auto repair business and run the plow business all year round.</p> <p>What sets Storks apart from other plow places is that plows are what we do. Plows are it for us - we install and work on them year round - it's what we love to do. We stock everything - not just the newest thing and the fast selling parts. We are not trying to sell everyone a new plow - that is not the goal. If you have an old plow and want to transfer it to a newer truck, if it can be done we will help you make that happen. You only have a budget for a used plow? We will help you with that too. We get calls daily from all over, and they tell us their plow needs a part, and the local dealer told them they cant get it, and they need to buy a new plow. Then they found the part on our site www.storksplows.com. This is what we love to do help people with what they need. Selling a new plow is great, but our focus is helping the customer with what they need, and a new plow is often not the answer.</p>",https://www.facebook.com/Storks-Plows-122253501191801/,49,1,,,storksPlows_WEB2.jpg,Storks Plows,,,610-488-1450,,Storks,Storks Plows,PA,,http://www.storksplows.com,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyQ8MdU8xSGRbWUhw8YjkRg,,k8Y2IKEsHhI,19506
